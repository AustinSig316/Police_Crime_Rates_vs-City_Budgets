Description of source of data 
- State/City budgets and finances
- Crime rates
- Poverty rates

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze past and recent crime rates in major metropolitain areas to determine if there is correlation between certain factors behind law enforcement and the rate of crime in the respective areas.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning will be built using Scikit. Unsupervised learning with a linear regression model will be utiliezed.

## Database
We have decided to use Postgres to manage the databases.
